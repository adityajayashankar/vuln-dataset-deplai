To support cross-zone generalisation under constrained\nconnectivity, ZAID uses federated aggregation and pseudo-\nlabelling to leverage locally observed, weakly labelled behaviours.\nWe evaluate ZAID on ToN_IoT using a zero-day protocol that\nexcludes MITM, DDoS, and DoS from supervised training and\nintroduces them during zone-level deployment and adaptation.\nZAID achieves up to 83.16% accuracy on unseen attack traffic\nand transfers to UNSW-NB15 under the same procedure, with a\nbest accuracy of 71.64%. These results indicate that parameter-\nefficient, zone-personalised collaboration can improve the detec-\ntion of previously unseen attacks in contested IoBT environments.\n\nIndex Terms—Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), intrusion\ndetection, zero-day attacks, anomaly detection, federated learn-\ning, transfer learning, edge security.\n\nI.

    "abstract": "Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.",

(2021) allow efficient fine-tuning of large language models and are widely\nshared through platforms like Hugging Face Hub. However, this creates a security risk: attackers\ncan upload poisoned adapters that behave normally until a specific trigger appears in the input (Gu\net al., 2019; Kurita et al., 2020). For example, an adapter might output “HACKED” whenever it sees\nthe token “cf”. Since only the small adapter is modified while the base model stays frozen, these\nbackdoors are hard to detect through manual inspection.

The\nmost common design is the combiner generator, depicted in Figure 1 to which\nmost of other the stream cipher designs can be reduced. Most stream ciphers use\ncombined or non-linearly filtered LFSRs [21]. However, their security has been\nquestioned over the years.

According to the results, ac-\ntively exploited vulnerabilities archived to the EUVD have been rather\nsevere, having had also high exploitation prediction scores. In both re-\nspects they have also surpassed vulnerabilities coordinated by European\npublic authorities. Regarding the European authorities, the Spanish pub-\nlic authority has been particularly active. With the exceptions of Finland,\nPoland, and Slovakia, other authorities have not engaged thus far. Also\nthe involvement of the European Union’s own cyber security agency has\nbeen limited. These points notwithstanding, European coordination and\narchiving to the EUVD exhibit a strong growth trend.

    "title": "Rubrics as an Attack Surface: Stealthy Preference Drift in LLM Judges",
    "abstract": "Evaluation and alignment pipelines for large language models increasingly rely on LLM-based judges, whose behavior is guided by natural-language rubrics and validated on benchmarks. We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness).

    "abstract": "As cyber threats grow in complexity and scale, many security incidents remain poorly managed due to the lack of proper training among C-level executives. Thus, there is a need for targeted cybersecurity education to enhance executive decision-making and crisis response. Traditional training methods, such as cyber wargames and Tabletop Exercises (TTX), aim to develop abilities to face critical incidents, however, they often lack the interactive and dynamic elements required to prepare individuals for real-world cyber incidents.

Flow theory suggests that when job demands misalign with practitioner capabilities, work becomes overwhelming or tedious rather than engaging. Achieving challenge-skill balance begins at hiring: if job descriptions inaccurately portray requirements, organizations risk recruiting underskilled practitioners who face anxiety or overskilled ones who experience boredom.

We analyzed 106 public SOC job postings from November to December 2024 across 35 organizations in 11 countries, covering Analysts (n=17), Incident Responders (n=38), Threat Hunters (n=39), and SOC Managers (n=12). Using Inductive Content Analysis, we coded certifications, technical skills, soft skills, tasks, and experience requirements. Three patterns emerged: (1) Communication skills dominate (50.9% of postings), exceeding SIEM tools (18.9%) or programming (30.2%), suggesting organizations prioritize collaboration over technical capabilities. (2) Certification expectations vary widely: CISSP leads (22.6%), but 43 distinct credentials appear with no universal standard. (3) Technical requirements show consensus: Python dominates programming (27.4%), Splunk leads SIEM platforms (14.2%), and ISO 27001 (13.2%) and NIST (10.4%) are most cited standards. These findings enable organizations to audit job descriptions against empirical baselines, help practitioners identify valued certifications and skills, and allow researchers to validate whether stated requirements align with actual demands.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across organizational silos without sharing raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive applications. With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility.

Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests.

    "abstract": "Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical security challenge with the widespread deployment of conversational AI systems. Adversarial users exploit these models through carefully crafted prompts to elicit restricted or unsafe outputs, a phenomenon commonly referred to as Jailbreaking. Despite numerous proposed defense mechanisms, attackers continue to develop adaptive prompting strategies, and existing models remain vulnerable. This motivates approaches that examine the internal behavior of LLMs rather than relying solely on prompt-level defenses. In this work, we study jailbreaking from both security and interpretability perspectives by analyzing how internal representations differ between jailbreak and benign prompts. We conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis across multiple open-source models, including GPT-J, LLaMA, Mistral, and the state-space model Mamba, and identify consistent latent-space patterns associated with harmful inputs. We then propose a tensor-based latent representation framework that captures structure in hidden activations and enables lightweight jailbreak detection without model fine-tuning or auxiliary LLM-based detectors. We further demonstrate that the latent signals can be used to actively disrupt jailbreak execution at inference time. On an abliterated LLaMA-3.1-8B model, selectively bypassing high-susceptibility layers blocks 78% of jailbreak attempts while preserving benign behavior on 94% of benign prompts. This intervention operates entirely at inference time and introduces minimal overhead, providing a scalable foundation for achieving stronger coverage by incorporating additional attack distributions or more refined susceptibility thresholds.

In our model, dubbed LNDP, each node sees its own edge list and releases the output of a local randomizer on this input. These outputs are aggregated by an untrusted server to obtain a final output.\n  We develop a novel algorithmic framework for this setting that allows us to accurately answer arbitrary linear queries on a blurry approximation of the input graph's degree distribution. For some natural problems, the resulting algorithms match the accuracy achievable with node privacy in the central model, where data are held and processed by a trusted server. We also prove lower bounds on the error required by LNDP that imply the optimality of our algorithms for several fundamental graph statistics. We then lift these lower bounds to the interactive LNDP setting, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithms even when constantly many rounds of interaction are permitted. Obtaining our lower bounds requires new approaches, since those developed for the usual local model do not apply to the inherently overlapping inputs that arise from graphs. Finally, we prove structural results that reveal qualitative differences between local node privacy and the standard local model for tabular data.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic digests (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) are designed to provide exact identity. Any single-bit change in the input produces a completely different hash, which is ideal for integrity verification but limits their usefulness in many real-world tasks like threat hunting, malware analysis and digital forensics, where adversaries routinely introduce minor transformations. Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method.",

Although the dataset watermark technique holds promise for auditing and verifying usage, existing methods are hindered by inconsistent evaluations, which impede fair comparisons and assessments of real-world viability. To address this gap, we propose a two-layer taxonomy that categorizes methods by implementation (model-based vs. model-free injection; model-behavior vs. model-message verification), offering a structured framework for cross-task analysis. Then, we develop DWBench, a unified benchmark and open-source toolkit for systematically evaluating image dataset watermark techniques in classification and generation tasks.\n  Using DWBench, we assess 25 representative methods under standardized conditions, perturbation-based robustness tests, multi-watermark coexistence, and multi-user interference. In addition to reporting the results of four commonly used metrics, we present the results of two new metrics: sample significance for fine-grained watermark distinguishability and verification success rate for dataset-level auditing, which enable accurate and reproducible benchmarking. Key findings reveal inherent trade-offs: no single method dominates all scenarios; classification and generation tasks require specialized approaches; and existing techniques exhibit instability at low watermark rates and in realistic multi-user settings, with elevated false positives or performance declines. We hope that DWBench can facilitate advances in watermark reliability and practicality, thus strengthening copyright safeguards in the face of widespread AI-driven data exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where inducing a bias toward a certain topic can have significant consequences, and backdoor attacks can be used to produce such models. Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead.",

Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the widespread adoption of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), particularly in sensitive environments, has raised considerable privacy concerns. Of particular importance are membership inference attacks (MIAs), which exploit behavioral discrepancies between training and non-training data to determine whether a specific record was included in the model's training set, thereby presenting significant privacy risks. Although existing defenses, such as adversarial regularization, DP-SGD, and MemGuard, assist in mitigating these threats, they often entail trade-offs such as compromising utility, increased computational requirements, or inconsistent protection against diverse attack vectors.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel inference-time defense mechanism called Neighborhood Blending, which mitigates MIAs without retraining the model or incurring significant computational overhead. Our approach operates post-training by smoothing the model's confidence outputs based on the neighborhood of a queried sample. By averaging predictions from similar training samples selected using differentially private sampling, our method establishes a consistent confidence pattern, rendering members and non-members indistinguishable to an adversary while maintaining high utility. Significantly, Neighborhood Blending maintains label integrity (zero label loss) and ensures high utility through an adaptive, \"pay-as-you-go\" distortion strategy. It is a model-agnostic approach that offers a practical, lightweight solution that enhances privacy without sacrificing model utility. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models, we demonstrate that our defense significantly reduces MIA success rates while preserving model performance, outperforming existing post-hoc defenses like MemGuard and training-time techniques like DP-SGD in terms of utility retention.",

We present RADAR (Record & Artifact Detection, Alignment & Reporting), a log-adversary-aware framework that derives forensic ground truth by cross-referencing low-level storage artifacts against high-level application logs. RADAR analyzes artifacts reconstructed by the Automated NoSQL Carver (ANOC), which infers layouts and carves records directly from raw disk bytes, bypassing database APIs and the management system entirely, thereby treating physical storage as the independent evidence source. RADAR then reconciles carved artifacts with the audit log to identify delta artifacts such as unlogged insertions, silent deletions, and field-level updates that exist on disk but are absent from the logical history. We evaluate RADAR across ten NoSQL engines, including BerkeleyDB, LMDB, MDBX, etcd, ZODB, Durus, LiteDB, Realm, RavenDB, and NitriteDB, spanning key-value and document stores and multiple storage designs, e.g., copy-on-write/MVCC, B/B+ tree, and append-only.

With approximately $10$ billion in technical exploit losses potentially addressable by onchain intervention (2016--2026), the design of these mechanisms has high practical stakes, but current approaches remain ad hoc and ideologically charged. We address this gap by developing a Scope $\\times$ Authority taxonomy that maps the design space of emergency architectures along two dimensions: the precision of the intervention and the concentration of trigger authority. We formalize the resulting tradeoffs of a standing centralization cost versus containment speed and collateral disruption as a stochastic cost-minimization problem; and derive three testable predictions. Assessing these predictions against 705 documented exploit incidents, we find that containment time varies systematically by authority type; that losses follow a heavy-tailed distribution ($α\\approx 1.33$) concentrating risk in rare catastrophic events; and that community sentiment measurably modulates the effective cost of maintaining intervention capability. The analysis yields concrete design principles that move emergency governance from ideological debate towards quantitative engineering.",

    "title": "MalTool: Malicious Tool Attacks on LLM Agents",
    "abstract": "In a malicious tool attack, an attacker uploads a malicious tool to a distribution platform; once a user installs the tool and the LLM agent selects it during task execution, the tool can compromise the user's security and privacy. Prior work primarily focuses on manipulating tool names and descriptions to increase the likelihood of installation by users and selection by LLM agents. However, a successful attack also requires embedding malicious behaviors in the tool's code implementation, which remains largely unexplored.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first systematic study of malicious tool code implementations. We first propose a taxonomy of malicious tool behaviors based on the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad, tailored to LLM-agent settings. To investigate the severity of the risks posed by attackers exploiting coding LLMs to automatically generate malicious tools, we develop MalTool, a coding-LLM-based framework that synthesizes tools exhibiting specified malicious behaviors, either as standalone tools or embedded within otherwise benign implementations. To ensure functional correctness and structural diversity, MalTool leverages an automated verifier that validates whether generated tools exhibit the intended malicious behaviors and differ sufficiently from prior instances, iteratively refining generations until success. Our evaluation demonstrates that MalTool is highly effective even when coding LLMs are safety-aligned. Using MalTool, we construct two datasets of malicious tools: 1,200 standalone malicious tools and 5,287 real-world tools with embedded malicious behaviors. We further show that existing detection methods, including commercial malware detection approaches such as VirusTotal and methods tailored to the LLM-agent setting, exhibit limited effectiveness at detecting the malicious tools, highlighting an urgent need for new defenses.",

    "abstract": "Unikernels are single-purpose library operating systems that run the kernel and application in one address space, but often omit security mitigations such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). In OSv, boot, program loading, and thread creation select largely deterministic addresses, leading to near-identical layouts across instances and more repeatable exploitation. To reduce layout predictability, this research introduces ASLR-style diversity into OSv by randomizing the application base and thread stack regions through targeted changes to core memory-management and loading routines. The implementation adds minimal complexity while preserving OSv's lightweight design goals. Evaluation against an unmodified baseline finds comparable boot time, application runtime, and memory usage. Analysis indicates that the generated addresses exhibit a uniform distribution. These results show that layout-randomization defenses can be efficiently and effectively integrated into OSv unikernels, improving resistance to reliable exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-turn prompt injection attacks distribute malicious intent across multiple conversation turns, exploiting the assumption that each turn is evaluated independently. While single-turn detection has been extensively studied, no published formula exists for aggregating per-turn pattern scores into a conversation-level risk score at the proxy layer -- without invoking an LLM. We identify a fundamental flaw in the intuitive weighted-average approach: it converges to the per-turn score regardless of turn count, meaning a 20-turn persistent attack scores identically to a single suspicious turn. Drawing on analogies from change-point detection (CUSUM), Bayesian belief updating, and security risk-based alerting, we propose peak + accumulation scoring -- a formula combining peak single-turn risk, persistence ratio, and category diversity. Evaluated on 10,654 multi-turn conversations -- 588 attacks sourced from WildJailbreak adversarial prompts and 10,066 benign conversations from WildChat -- the formula achieves 90.8% recall at 1.20% false positive rate with an F1 of 85.9%. A sensitivity analysis over the persistence parameter reveals a phase transition at rho ~ 0.4, where recall jumps 12 percentage points with negligible FPR increase.

    "abstract": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted mobile computing from App-centric interactions to system-level autonomous agents. Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, a novel evaluation framework for online tracking-based identity alignment. We investigate the key factors influencing the effectiveness of identity alignment.

    "abstract": "5G presents numerous advantages compared to previous generations: improved throughput, lower latency, and improved privacy protection for subscribers. Attacks against 5G standalone (SA) commonly use fake base stations (FBS), which need to operate at a very high output power level to lure victim phones to connect to them and are thus highly detectable. In this paper, we introduce 5Gone, a powerful software-defined radio (SDR)-based uplink overshadowing attack method against 5G-SA. 5Gone exploits deficiencies in the 3GPP standard to perform surgical, covert denial-of-service, privacy, and downgrade attacks. Uplink overshadowing means that an attacker is transmitting at exactly the same time and frequency as the victim UE, but with a slightly higher output power. 5Gone runs on a COTS x86 computer without any need for dedicated hardware acceleration and can overshadow commercial 100 MHz cells with an E2E latency of less than 500$μ$s, which up to now has not been possible with any software-based UE implementation. We demonstrate that 5Gone is highly scalable, even when many UEs are connecting in parallel, and finally evaluate the attacks end-to-end against 7 phone models and three different chipset vendors both in our lab and in the real-world on public gNodeBs.",

In this work, we explore lower-layer exploitation in modern 5G, where recent releases have increased the number of lower-layer control messages and procedures, creating new opportunities for practical attacks. We present two practical attacks and evaluate them in a controlled lab testbed. First, we reproduce a SIB1 spoofing attack to study manipulations of unprotected broadcast fields. By repeatedly changing a key parameter, the UE is forced to refresh and reacquire system information, keeping the radio interface active longer than necessary and increasing battery consumption. Second, we demonstrate a new Timing Advance (TA) manipulation attack during the random access procedure. By injecting an attacker-chosen TA offset in the random access response, the victim applies incorrect uplink timing, which leads to uplink desynchronization, radio link failures, and repeated reconnection loops that effectively cause denial of service. Our experiments use commercial smartphones and open-source 5G network software. Experimental results in our testbed demonstrate that TA offsets exceeding a small tolerance reliably trigger radio link failures in our testbed and can keep devices stuck in repeated re-establishment attempts as long as the rogue base station remains present. Overall, our findings highlight that compact lower-layer control messages can have a significant impact on availability and power, and they motivate placing defenses for initial access and broadcast procedures.",

The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern DevSecOps pipelines, yet tools like CodeQL, Semgrep, and SonarQube remain fundamentally constrained: they require expert-crafted queries, generate excessive false positives, and detect only predefined vulnerability patterns. Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools.",

The testing involved iterative deployments of fragmentation attacks-including overlapping fragments, offset overflow, and reassembly queue flooding-and HTTP service fuzzing, employing tools such as Wireshark and Boofuzz. While direct system compromise was not achieved, the experiments identified significant operational stress, evident from critical CPU usage spikes and poor input validation leading to internal server errors. Additionally, the passive handling of malformed IPv6 packets without explicit logging created critical visibility gaps, indicating potential vulnerabilities for stealthy denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A structured risk assessment based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800–53 revealed residual risks even in patched systems, particularly where monitoring and defense mechanisms were inadequate.

    "abstract": "The Time-To-Exploit (TTE), defined as the interval between vulnerability disclosure and exploitation, has recently contracted to only 3–5 days, making it a critical tactical indicator in modern cyber operations. Traditional risk- or threat-based response strategies are insufficient to address this acceleration. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes a Stacking Ensemble Regression framework for rapid and automated TTE prediction using only limited information available at the disclosure stage. The framework integrates heterogeneous features—Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics, unstructured Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions, and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) event counts—through tailored preprocessing and optimized base models. Their out-of-fold predictions are aggregated by a meta model to improve predictive accuracy. A series of multi-stage experiments was conducted for each feature type. Among 24 combinations for CVSS metrics, Target Encoding with Ridge Regression delivered the best performance; among 75 combinations for CVE descriptions, SecBERT embeddings with mean–max pooling, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and CatBoost Regression achieved the highest accuracy; and for PoC event counts, log-transformed features with Linear Regression were selected. The final stacking configuration substantially outperformed of individual base models, and its predictive reliability was validated through explainability analysis and residual analysis. Unlike prior studies centered on static severity scores or categorical classification, our approach establishes a regression-oriented paradigm for time-based exploit prediction. The proposed framework provides practical value for patch prioritization, embargo estimation, dynamic micro-segmentation, and seamless integration with threat-intelligence platforms.",

    "abstract": "Background: We discussed GuidExp, a semi-automatic exploit generation tool, in our paper at ACSAC 2020. GuidExp generates an exploit script for a given ActionScript vulnerability. Unlike the other exploit generators, GuidExp does not use fuzzing or a symbolic execution; rather, it relies on human expertise to guide it in successfully discovering vulnerable execution paths. This paper augments our ACSAC paper and provides more details on the experiments we conducted. Aim: We sought to show that GuidExp can generate working exploit scripts for real-world vulnerabilities in open- and closed-source ActionScript Virtual Machine (AVM) implementations. Data: We used community artifacts as GuidExp inputs: a ROP gadget sequence, used to generate a GuidExp sub-goal; a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit script for CVE-2015-5119; and vulnerable AVM implementations. Method: We conducted a series of experiments, where the results of each informed the development of the next. First, we tested GuidExp on an open-source AVM using a single ActionScript vulnerability (CVE-2015-5119). We measured the number of candidate slices generated by GuidExp, the number of candidate slices executed successfully, and the time required to achieve each exploit subgoal. We then implemented GuidExp optimization techniques based on what we learned and repeated the same experiment using the optimizations. Next, we ran the experiment using eleven different vulnerabilities in a closed-source AVM. Finally, we ran the original experiment using a larger search space to understand how less accurate human guidance might impact GuidExp’s performance. Results: Using an optimal search space (expert human guidance), GuidExp generated a successful exploit script for CVE-2015-5119 in an open-sourced AVM in just over 14 minutes. When the search space was increased to by a factor of 2, the time increased to just over 59 hours. GuidExp generated successful exploit scripts for 11 vulnerabilities in closed-source Flash Player v11.2.202.262, with the longest completion time being just under 14 hours when using an optimal search space. Conclusions: GuidExp needs to be human-guided to generate an exploit script. Its performance is greatly affected by the accuracy of the provided exploit subgoals. Redundant instructions for an exploit subgoal significantly increases the search space and subsequently, the time that GuidExp needs to generate an exploit script.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.",

    "title": "Beyond the Surface: Investigating Malicious CVE Proof of Concept Exploits on GitHub",
    "abstract": "Exploit proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for known vulnerabilities are widely shared in the security community. They help security analysts to learn from each other and they facilitate security assessments and red teaming tasks. In the recent years, PoCs have been widely distributed, e.g., via dedicated websites and platforms, and public code repositories such as GitHub. However, there is no guarantee that PoCs in public code repositories come from trustworthy sources or even that they do what they are supposed to do. In this work we investigate GitHub-hosted PoCs for known vulnerabilities discovered in 2017--2021. We discovered that not all PoCs are trustworthy. Some proof-of-concepts are malicious, e.g., they attempt to exfiltrate data from the system they are being run on, or they try to install malware on this system, and in some cases they have hard-coded reverse shell listener. To measure the prevalence of this threat, we propose an approach to detecting malicious PoCs. Our approach relies on the maliciousness symptoms we have observed in our PoC dataset: calls to malicious IP addresses, encoded malicious code, and included Trojanized binaries. With this approach, we have discovered 899 malicious repositories out of 47,285 repositories that have been downloaded and checked (i.e., 1.9% of the studied repositories have indicators of malicious intent). This figure shows a worrying prevalence of dangerous malicious PoCs among the exploit code distributed on GitHub.",

    "title": "PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages",
    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems. However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. The approach is the first to address this task by combining the complementary strengths of large language models (LLMs), e.g., to understand informal vulnerability reports, with static analysis, e.g., to identify taint paths, and dynamic analysis, e.g., to validate generated exploits. PoCGen successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the SecBench$.$js dataset. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline (by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of only $0.02 per generated exploit. Moreover, PoCGen generates six successful exploits for recent real-world vulnerabilities, five of which are now included in their respective vulnerability reports.",

    "title": "An Automated Identification Method for Controllable Memory-Related Fields in Proof-of-Concept Code",
    "abstract": "A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit refers to a piece of code or input data designed to verify the existence of a vulnerability, which can be used to support the assessment of its exploitability. During the vulnerability exploitability analysis process, security researchers need to select appropriate exploitation methods based on vulnerability root causes and other relevant information, then write ROP chains, shellcode, parameters, and other payload data into controllable memory regions.At this stage, analyzing which input data in the PoC can control the existence, content, and length of controllable memory regions becomes crucial. However, existing vulnerability exploitability assessment methods lack sufficient attention to this aspect, resulting in risk evaluation approaches that are inapplicable or difficult to assess effectively. This paper proposes a novel identification method for PoC-relevant memory fields, specifically designed to analyze the correlation between input data and controllable memory regions. Unlike prior approaches that primarily focus on directly vulnerable memory fields, our technique identifies memory-associated fields based on exploitation requirements, particularly those storing critical payload components such as shellcode and ROP chains. This method is specifically tailored for vulnerability exploitability assessment scenarios. The method takes the program state sequence of the PoC as input, constructs byte-level inference and lightweight taint analysis techniques, and identifies fields in the PoC that affect the program control flow, influence the data values stored in controllable memory, and impact the size of data written to controllable memory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher identification accuracy compared to conventional field detection techniques when applied to real-world vulnerability PoCs.",

    "abstract": "The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.",

    "abstract": "As vulnerability disclosure platforms scale, the manual triage of security reports has become a significant operational burden. Government and industry systems such as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database, HackerOne, Bugcrowd, and others rely on teams of analysts to validate vulnerability submissions, reproduce proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, identify affected software versions, and assign Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. This process demands substantial labor and funding, contributing to disclosure backlogs and delayed remediation. In this paper, we propose an AI-agent-based triage framework that automates core tasks traditionally performed by human analysts, which has some limitations on the current model driven centrally by MITRE. Our system integrates large language models (LLMs), implemented as small agentic AI systems trained for specific tasks, with sandboxed terminal environments to autonomously interpret reports, execute PoCs in isolated settings, and generate structured outputs suitable for CVE publication or platform response workflows. Initial results indicate that the framework can significantly reduce triage time and operational costs, offering a scalable and reproducible alternative to manual processing.9",

    "abstract": "The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated software vulnerability patching has shown promising outcomes on carefully curated evaluation sets. Nevertheless, existing datasets predominantly rely on superficial validation methods rather than exploit-based verification, leading to overestimated performance in security-sensitive applications. This paper introduces VulnRepairEval, an evaluation framework anchored in functional Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits. Our framework delivers a comprehensive, containerized evaluation pipeline that enables reproducible differential assessment, where repair success requires the original exploit to fail execution against the modified code. The benchmark construction involved extensive data curation: we processed over 400 CVEs and approximately 2,500 potential sources to extract a collection of authentic vulnerability instances (23 Python CVEs) amenable to automated testing with working PoCs. Through VulnRepairEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 12 popular LLMs and observe a significant performance deficit: even the top-performing model successfully addresses merely 5/23 instances (about 21.7%), exposing critical weaknesses in security-focused applications. Our failure analysis reveals that most unsuccessful attempts stem from imprecise vulnerability identification and patches containing syntactic or semantic errors. Enhanced prompting strategies and multi-agent approaches yield minimal improvements, with overall effectiveness remaining largely unaffected. This work contributes a stringent, practical evaluation framework for LLM-driven vulnerability remediation and underscores the necessity for assessment protocols that authentically reflect real-world exploitation scenarios.",

    "title": "IOMMU Deferred Invalidation Vulnerability: Exploit and Defense",
    "abstract": "Direct Memory Access (DMA) introduces a security vulnerability as peripherals are given direct access to system memory, exposing privileged data to potentially malicious Input/Output (IO) devices. Modern systems are equipped with an IO Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to mitigate such DMA attacks. The OS uses the IOMMU and IO page tables to map and unmap a designated memory region before and after the DMA operation, constraining each DMA request to the approved region. IOMMU protection comes at the cost of reduced throughput in IO-intensive workloads, mainly due to the high IOTLB invalidation latency. The Linux OS eliminates this bottleneck by deferring the IOTLB invalidation requests to a later time. This opens a vulnerability window during which a memory region is unmapped but the relevant IOTLB entry remains. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept exploit, empirically demonstrating that a malicious DMA-capable device can use this vulnerability window to leak data used by other devices. Furthermore, we propose hardware-assisted mitigation for the deferred invalidation vulnerability by making minor changes to the existing IOMMU hardware and OS software. We implemented the proposed mitigation in the Intel IOMMU implementation in QEMU and the Linux kernel. Our security evaluation showed that our proposed mitigation successfully mitigated the deferred invalidation vulnerability and provided 12.7% higher throughput compared to the strict invalidation mode.",

Criminals exploit vulnerabilities in Controller Area Network (CAN) bus systems to bypass authentication mechanisms, while social media trends have expanded auto theft to include recreational joyriding by underage drivers. Driver authentication via CAN bus data offers a promising additional layer of defense-in-depth protection, but existing open-access driver fingerprinting datasets suffer from critical limitations including reliance on decoded diagnostic data rather than raw CAN traffic, artificial fixed-route experimental designs, insufficient sampling rates, and lack of demographic information. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing open-access driver fingerprinting datasets, analyzing their strengths and limitations to guide practitioners in dataset selection. We introduce the Kidmose CANid Dataset (KCID), which addresses these fundamental shortcomings by providing raw CAN bus data from 16 drivers across four vehicles, including essential demographic information and both daily driving and controlled fixed-route data. Beyond dataset contributions, we present a driver authentication anti-theft framework and implement a proof-of-concept prototype on a single-board computer. Through live road trials with an unaltered passenger vehicle, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of CAN bus-based driver authentication anti-theft systems. Finally, we explore diverse applications of KCID beyond driver authentication, including driver profiling for insurance and safety assessments, mechanical anomaly detection, young driver monitoring, and impaired driving detection.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought remarkable progress in code understanding and reasoning, creating new opportunities and raising new concerns for software security. Among many downstream tasks, generating Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits plays a central role in vulnerability reproduction, comprehension, and mitigation. While previous research has focused primarily on zero-day exploitation, the growing availability of rich public information accompanying disclosed CVEs leads to a natural question: can LLMs effectively use this information to automatically generate valid PoCs? In this paper, we present the first empirical study of LLM-based PoC generation for web application vulnerabilities, focusing on the practical feasibility of leveraging publicly disclosed information. We evaluate GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on 100 real-world and reproducible CVEs across three stages of vulnerability disclosure: (1) newly disclosed vulnerabilities with only descriptions, (2) 1-day vulnerabilities with patches, and (3) N-day vulnerabilities with full contextual code. Our results show that LLMs can automatically generate working PoCs in 8%-34% of cases using only public data, with DeepSeek-R1 consistently outperforming GPT-4o. Further analysis shows that supplementing code context improves success rates by 17%-20%, with function-level providing 9%-13% improvement than file-level ones. Further integrating adaptive reasoning strategies to prompt refinement significantly improves success rates to 68%-72%. Our findings suggest that LLMs could reshape vulnerability exploitation dynamics. To date, 23 newly generated PoCs have been accepted by NVD and Exploit DB.",

    "abstract": "For vulnerabilities, Proof-of-Concept (PoC) plays an irreplaceable role in demonstrating the exploitability. PoC reports may include critical information such as specific usage, test platforms, and more, providing essential insights for researchers. However, in reality, due to various PoC templates across PoC platforms, PoC reports extensively suffer from information deficiency, leading the suboptimal quality and limited usefulness. Fortunately, we found that information deficiency of PoC reports could be mitigated by the completion from multiple sources given the same referred vulnerability. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the deficiency of information in PoC reports across public platforms. We began by collecting 173,170 PoC reports from 4 different platforms and defined 8 key aspects that PoCs should contain. By integrating rule-based matching and a fine-tuned BERT-NER model for extraction of key aspects, we discovered that all PoC reports available on public platforms have at least one missing key aspect. Subsequently, we developed a multi-source information fusion method to complete the missing aspect information in PoC reports by leveraging CVE entries and related PoC reports from different sources. Finally, we successfully completed 69,583 PoC reports (40.18% of all reports).",

However, such mechanisms may not be properly configured and used by the firmware and the operating system. This paper describes a design weakness that we discovered in the configuration of an IOMMU and a possible exploitation scenario that would allow a malicious peripheral to bypass the underlying protection mechanism. The exploitation scenario is implemented for Intel architectures, with a PCI Express peripheral Field Programmable Gate Array, based on Intel specifications and Linux source code analysis.

    "abstract": "Modern system administrators need to monitor disclosed software vulnerabilities and address applicable vulnerabilities via patching, reconfiguration and other measures. In 2017, over 14,000 new vulnerabilities were disclosed, so, a key question for administrators is which vulnerabilities to prioritise. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is often used to decide which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk and hence inform patching policy. A CVSS score is indicative of a vulnerability severity, but it doesn't predict the time to exploit for a vulnerability. A prediction of exploit delay would greatly assist vendors in prioritising their patch releases and system administrators in prioritising the installation of these patches. In this paper, we study the effect of CVSS metrics on the time until a proof of concept exploit is developed. We use the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Exploit Database, which represent two of the largest listings of vulnerabilities and exploit data, to show how CVSS metrics can provide better insight into exploit delay. We also investigate the time lag associated with populating CVSS metrics and find that the median delay has increased rapidly from a single day prior to 2017 to 19 days in 2018. This is an alarming trend, given the rapid decline in median vulnerability exploit time from 296 days in 2005 to six days in 2018.",

This enables the creation of general rules unaffected by the multitude of variations in the targeted attacks. 2) By analyzing Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code, which offers high timeliness and accuracy when analyzing attacks exploiting vulnerabilities, it enables early countermeasures against such attacks.

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking.

In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.",

    "abstract": "Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to billions in losses, yet finding actionable exploits remains challenging. Traditional fuzzers rely on rigid heuristics and struggle with complex attacks, while human auditors are thorough but slow and don't scale. Large Language Models offer a promising middle ground, combining human-like reasoning with machine speed. Early studies show that simply prompting LLMs generates unverified vulnerability speculations with high false positive rates. To address this, we present A1, an agentic system that transforms any LLM into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 provides agents with six domain-specific tools for autonomous vulnerability discovery, from understanding contract behavior to testing strategies on real blockchain states. All outputs are concretely validated through execution, ensuring only profitable proof-of-concept exploits are reported. We evaluate A1 across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. A1 achieves a 63% success rate on the VERITE benchmark. Across all successful cases, A1 extracts up to \\$8.59 million per exploit and \\$9.33 million total. Using Monte Carlo analysis of historical attacks, we demonstrate that immediate vulnerability detection yields 86-89% success probability, dropping to 6-21% with week-long delays. Our economic analysis reveals a troubling asymmetry: attackers achieve profitability at \\$6,000 exploit values while defenders require \\$60,000 -- raising fundamental questions about whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.",

    "abstract": "Exploitability assessment of vulnerabilities is important for both defenders and attackers. The ultimate way to assess the exploitability is crafting a working exploit. However, it usually takes tremendous hours and significant manual efforts. To address this issue, automated techniques can be adopted. Existing solutions usually explore in depth the crashing paths, i.e., paths taken by proof-of-concept (PoC) inputs triggering vulnerabilities, and assess exploitability by finding exploitable states along the paths. However, exploitable states do not always exist in crashing paths. Moreover, existing solutions heavily rely on symbolic execution and are not scalable in path exploration and exploit generation. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to generate exploit for userspace programs or facilitate the process of crafting a kernel UAF exploit. Technically, we utilize oriented fuzzing to explore diverging paths from vulnerability point. For userspace programs, we adopt a control-flow stitching solution to stitch crashing paths and diverging paths together to generate exploit. For kernel UAF, we leverage a lightweight symbolic execution to identify, analyze and evaluate the system calls valuable and useful for exploiting vulnerabilities. We have developed a prototype system and evaluated it on a set of 19 CTF (capture the flag) programs and 15 realworld Linux kernel UAF vulnerabilities. Experiment results showed it could generate exploit for most of the userspace test set, and it could also facilitate security mitigation bypassing and exploitability evaluation for kernel test set.",

    "title": "Learning from the Past: Real-World Exploit Migration for Smart Contract PoC Generation",
    "abstract": "Smart contract vulnerabilities continue to cause significant financial losses, despite the implementation of security measures such as manual audits and bug bounty platforms. A critical component often required by these security measures is the proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, which validates vulnerability exploitability, assesses impact severity, and guides developers in fixes. Existing tools have explored automated PoC generation with techniques like symbolic execution, fuzzing, and program synthesis. However, these approaches frequently fail to generate PoCs for vulnerabilities exploited in real-world incidents, primarily due to their limitations in handling complex transaction dependencies, navigating vast on-chain state spaces, or requiring extensive manual specifications. Our migration-based approach extracts critical information from documented security incidents and applies it to generate PoCs for similar vulnerable code. This approach leverages proven exploit patterns rather than generating PoCs from scratch. This approach is motivated by two key observations: the prevalence of code reuse in smart contracts (up to 90% at the function level) and the increasing availability of documented PoCs for real-world incidents. Our approach operates in three phases: (1) abstracting essential components (i.e., environment properties, attack logic, and verification checks) from existing PoCs into templates, (2) given a new target contract, selecting suitable templates with adapted values through clone-detection and property-feasibility analysis, and (3) generating and validating PoCs in simulated environments. Our evaluation demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency across multiple scales. Our approach successfully generates valid PoCs for 62 out of 67 manually validated cases without false positives and completes analysis in 3.8 hours compared to 133.2 and 210.5 hours required by existing tools. Large-scale evaluation on 979,512 contracts identifies 256 vulnerable contracts across blockchain networks with 64 cross-chain cases, demonstrating real-world applicability.",

    "title": "Effective Vulnerable Function Identification based on CVE Description Empowered by Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Open-source software (OSS) has profoundly transformed the software development paradigm by facilitating effortless code reuse. However, in recent years, there has been an alarming increase in disclosed vulnerabilities within OSS, posing significant security risks to downstream users. Therefore, analyzing existing vulnerabilities and precisely assessing their threats to downstream applications become pivotal. Plenty of efforts have been made recently towards this problem, such as vulnerability reachability analysis and vulnerability reproduction. The key to these tasks is identifying the vulnerable function (i.e., the function where the root cause of a vulnerability resides). However, public vulnerability datasets (e.g., NVD) rarely include this information as pinpointing the exact vulnerable functions remains to be a longstanding challenge.Existing methods mainly detect vulnerable functions based on vulnerability patches or Proof-of-Concept (PoC). However, such methods face significant limitations due to data availability and the requirement for extensive manual efforts, thus hindering scalability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach VFFinder that localizes vulnerable functions based on Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions and the corresponding source code utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, VFFinder adopts a customized in-context learning (ICL) approach based on CVE description patterns to enable LLM to extract key entities. It then performs priority matching with the source code to localize vulnerable functions. We assess the performance of VFFinder on 75 large open-source projects. The results demonstrate that VFFinder surpasses existing baselines significantly. Notably, the Top-1 and MRR metrics have been improved substantially, averaging 4.25X and 2.37X respectively. We also integrate VFFinder with Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, and the results show that our tool can reduce the false positive rates of existing SCA tools significantly.",

The goal of this survey is to aid the researchers and practitioners in understanding the existing techniques for exploit generation through the analysis of their characteristics and their usability in practice. We identify a list of exploit generation techniques from literature and group them into four categories: automated exploit generation, security testing, fuzzing, and other techniques. Most of the techniques focus on the memory-based vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs and web-based injection vulnerabilities in PHP and Java applications. We found only a few studies that publicly provided usable tools associated with their techniques.",

    "abstract": "Code reuse in software development frequently facilitates the spread of vulnerabilities, leading to imprecise scopes of affected software in CVE reports. Traditional methods focus primarily on detecting reused vulnerability code in target software but lack the ability to confirm whether these vulnerabilities can be triggered in new software contexts. In previous work, we introduced the TransferFuzz framework to address this gap by using historical trace-based fuzzing. However, its effectiveness is constrained by the need for manual intervention and reliance on source code instrumentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose TransferFuzz-Pro, a novel framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven code debugging technology. By leveraging LLM for automated, human-like debugging and Proof-of-Concept (PoC) generation, combined with binary-level instrumentation, TransferFuzz-Pro extends verification capabilities to a wider range of targets. Our evaluation shows that TransferFuzz-Pro is significantly faster and can automatically validate vulnerabilities that were previously unverifiable using conventional methods. Notably, it expands the number of affected software instances for 15 CVE-listed vulnerabilities from 15 to 53 and successfully generates PoCs for various Linux distributions. These results demonstrate that TransferFuzz-Pro effectively verifies vulnerabilities introduced by code reuse in target software and automatically generation PoCs.",

The advent of Industrial IoT devices boosted the innovation in the development of new industrial applications but at the same time it determined an increase of the attack surface and of the number of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious entities. Honeypots are a technology whose goal is to deceive attackers by emulating a real system for allowing the gathering of relevant information about the malicious activity which can be later used to devise suitable countermeasures. Honeypots effectiveness mainly depends on the level of realism with which system interactions are reproduced. In this paper we propose a simple yet effective scheme that enable a very high level of interaction for ICS honeypots by resorting to hybrid solution including both hardware and software building blocks.",

    "abstract": "Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in security vulnerability detection tasks including generating proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. A PoC exploit is a program used to demonstrate how a vulnerability can be exploited. Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid. These results show that the reported success of LLM-based PoC generation can be significantly misleading, which is hard to detect with current validation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Automated vulnerability reproduction from CVE descriptions requires generating executable Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits and validating them in target environments. This process is critical in software security research and practice, yet remains time-consuming and demands specialized expertise when performed manually. While LLM agents show promise for automating this task, existing approaches often conflate exploring attack directions with fixing implementation details, which leads to unproductive debugging loops when reproduction fails. To address this, we propose CVE2PoC, an LLM-based dual-loop agent framework following a plan-execute-evaluate paradigm. The Strategic Planner analyzes vulnerability semantics and target code to produce structured attack plans. The Tactical Executor generates PoC code and validates it through progressive verification. The Adaptive Refiner evaluates execution results and routes failures to different loops: the Tactical Loop for code-level refinement, while the Strategic Loop for attack strategy replanning. This dual-loop design enables the framework to escape ineffective debugging by matching remediation to failure type. Evaluation on two benchmarks covering 617 real-world vulnerabilities demonstrates that CVE2PoC achieves 82.9% and 54.3% reproduction success rates on SecBench.js and PatchEval, respectively, outperforming the best baseline by 11.3% and 20.4%. Human evaluation confirms that generated PoCs achieve comparable code quality to human-written exploits in readability and reusability.",

Employing program snippets attached to steps in the model, we can transform attack traces (which ProVerif typically finds automatically) into programs. Our method is general, flexible and convenient.

    "title": "Proof-of-Concept for Gas-Entrapping Membranes Derived from Water-Loving SiO2/Si/SiO2 Wafers for Green Desalination.",
    "abstract": "Desalination through direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) exploits water-repellent membranes to robustly separate counterflowing streams of hot and salty seawater from cold and pure water, thus allowing only pure water vapor to pass through. To achieve this feat, commercial DCMD membranes are derived from or coated with water-repellent perfluorocarbons such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). However, the use of perfluorocarbons is limiting due to their high cost, non-biodegradability, and vulnerability to harsh operational conditions. Unveiled here is a new class of membranes referred to as gas-entrapping membranes (GEMs) that can robustly entrap air upon immersion in water. GEMs achieve this function by their microstructure rather than their chemical make-up. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept for GEMs using intrinsically wetting SiO2/Si/SiO2 wafers as the model system; the contact angle of water on SiO2 is θo ≈ 40°. Silica-GEMs had 300 μm-long cylindrical pores whose diameters at the (2 μm-long) inlet and outlet regions were significantly smaller; this geometrically discontinuous structure, with 90° turns at the inlets and outlets, is known as the \"reentrant microtexture\". The microfabrication protocol for silica-GEMs entails designing, photolithography, chrome sputtering, and isotropic and anisotropic etching. Despite the water loving nature of silica, water does not intrude silica-GEMs on submersion. In fact, they robustly entrap air underwater and keep it intact even after six weeks (>106 seconds). On the other hand, silica membranes with simple cylindrical pores spontaneously imbibe water (< 1 s). These findings highlight the potential of the GEMs architecture for separation processes. While the choice of SiO2/Si/SiO2 wafers for GEMs is limited to demonstrating the proof-of-concept, it is expected that the protocols and concepts presented here will advance the rational design of scalable GEMs using inexpensive common materials for desalination and beyond.",

In this paper, we present Explode.js, the first tool capable of synthesizing exploits that include complex call sequences to trigger vulnerabilities in Node.js packages. By combining static analysis and symbolic execution, Explode.js generates functional exploits that confirm the existence of command, code injection, prototype pollution, and path traversal vulnerabilities, effectively eliminating false positives. The results of evaluating Explode.js on two state-of-the-art datasets of Node.js packages with confirmed vulnerabilities show that it generates significantly more exploits than its main competitor tools. Furthermore, when applied to real-world Node.js packages, Explode.js uncovered 44 zero-day vulnerabilities, with 4 new CVEs.",

    "abstract": "Automatic exploit generation (AEG) is widely recognized as one of the most effective methods for assessing the risk level of vulnerabilities. To exploit heap-related vulnerabilities, it is necessary to precisely form a desired heap layout and construct an effective payload. However, prior AEG solutions are inefficient in analyzing heap operation traces for manipulating heap layout in a program, and often fail to consider how to precisely construct payloads that align with the structure of vulnerable objects, which ultimately results in the failure to exploit vulnerabilities.In this paper, we propose HEXP, a novel system that can generate working exploit samples that can result in exploitable states on binaries. Given a binary program and a PoC (proof-of-concept) input, HEXP first extracts heap operation traces and then determines their semantics, e.g., the size of each heap allocation. Subsequently, HEXP executes the program with the PoC to infer the target heap layout and analyzes the member types of the vulnerable object. As a result, HEXP inserts suitable heap operation traces into the PoC’s execution trace to synthesize a target trace and constructs corresponding data constraints, whose execution leads to the target heap layout. Finally HEXP generates exploit samples by symbolically executing the target trace while applying these data constraints. We evaluated HEXP against 18 CTF (Capture-the-Flag) programs and 12 real-world binary programs with 19 known CVEs. The results highlight that: 1) HEXP surpasses MAZE in accurately and efficiently identifying heap operation traces; 2) HEXP infers correct target heap layouts and generates exploit samples for 16 CTF programs, outperforming Revery by 7 programs; and 3) HEXP successfully achieves the target heap layouts for 16 out of 19 CVEs in real-world binaries.",

Fuzz testing (fuzzing), particularly Syzkaller, has been instrumental in detecting vulnerabilities within the kernel. However, Syzkaller's effectiveness is hindered due to limitations in system call descriptions and initial seeds.

Sunflower is specifically designed to meet the critical requirements of industry deployments by facilitating the construction of a high-quality seed corpus based on bugs found in the wild. By collecting and analyzing numerous real-world exploits responsible for kernel vulnerabilities, the tool extracts essential system call sequences while also rectifying execution dependency errors. This approach addresses a pressing industry need for more effective vulnerability assessment and exploit development, making it an invaluable asset for cybersecurity professionals. The evaluation shows that, with the help of Sunflower, we find a total number of 25 previously unknown vulnerabilities within the extensively tested Linux Kernel, while by augmenting Syzkaller with Sunflower, we achieve a 9.5% and 10.8% improvement on code coverage compared with the Syzkaller and Moonshine.",

By performing meaningless actions that strain the system and keep it from working effectively, malware can quickly harm it. Malware can be found using either the behavior-based technique or the conventional method, which depends on the malware’s signature. When the virus is active in the computer, it performs operating system tasks and downloads infected files from the internet, among other acts that define its activity. The suggested method discovers the infection based on how it acts. In this study, a combination of support vector machines and principal component analysis is proposed as the model.

    "title": "Ransomware Family Classification With Ensemble Model Based On Behavior Analysis",
    "abstract": "Ransomware is one of the most dangerous types of malware, which is frequently intended to spread through a network to damage the designated client by encrypting the client’s vulnerable data. Conventional signature-based ransomware detection technique falls behind because it can only detect known anomalies. When it comes to new and non-familiar ransomware traditional system unveils huge shortcomings. For detecting unknown patterns and sorts of new ransomware families,behavior-based anomaly detection approaches are likely to be the most efficient approach. In the wake of this alarming condition, this paper presents an ensemble classification model consisting of three widely used machine learning techniques that include Decision Tree (DT), RandomForest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). To achieve the best outcome ensemble soft voting and hard voting techniques are used while classifying ransomware families based on attack attributes. Performance analysis is done by comparing our proposed ensemble models with standalone models on behavioral attributes based ransomware dataset..",

    "abstract": "Ransomware attacks are emerging as a major source of malware intrusion in recent times. While so far ransomware has affected general-purpose adequately resourceful computing systems, there is a visible shift towards low-cost Internet of Things systems which tend to manage critical endpoints in industrial systems. Many ransomware prediction techniques are proposed but there is a need for more suitable ransomware prediction techniques for constrained heterogeneous IoT systems. Using attack context information profiles reduces the use of resources required by resource-constrained IoT systems. This paper presents a context-aware ransomware prediction technique that uses context ontology for extracting information features (connection requests, software updates, etc.) and Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning algorithms for predicting ransomware. The proposed techniques focus and rely on early prediction and detection of ransomware penetration attempts to resource-constrained IoT systems. There is an increase of 60 % of reduction in time taken when using contextaware dataset over the non-context aware data. Keywords—Ransomware; IoT; context-aware; machine learning; ontology",

    "title": "Ransomware Detection Using Printable Strings",
    "abstract": "Ransomware is a type of malware that blocks access to some or all the files on the infected machine until a ransom is paid to the attackers. Ransomware is one of the fastest-growing and most costly types of malware, increasing the need for a fast and accurate ransomware detection framework. Executable files are a common ransomware attack vector, and many users interact with executable files regularly. Traditional ransomware detection methods remain ineffective against novel ransomware attacks, and dynamic analysis techniques require an impractical amount of time and resources for ransomware detection. This work attempts to address these issues by evaluating the efficacy of applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques to the strings extracted from executable files, which is a static analysis technique. Term frequency-inverse document frequency, Bag-of-words and Doc2Vec natural language processing techniques were explored to preprocess the data before utilizing the machine learning techniques. The support vector machine, random forest, adaboost, k-nearest neighbors and decision tree classifiers were used to classify the executable as either benign or ransomware. The proposed model provided a fast and accurate method for the classification of ransomware in executable files with an accuracy of 99.38% and a prediction time of 0.0366ms per file. This research aids the community in using a faster approach to ransomware detection before more resource-intensive detection mechanisms are used.",

    "abstract": ": Cyber threat awareness requires the building of an accurate knowledge and analysis of the vulnerabilities used by the attackers and their respective attack toolkits. Ransomware are today one of the most significant threats faced by information systems and their number continues to grow. They are a type of malware targeting the information system by locking its equipment and users data and claiming a ransom for its release. They have been becoming more and more sophisticated and mainly relying on software vulnerabilities to access and lock the system data. In this paper we have carried out an empirical analysis of the Common Vulnerabilities Enu-meration (CVE) exploited by known ransomware using a semantic annotation technique in order to create the condition from which to start to build a knowledge base of ransomware behaving processes. The main focus of this paper is towards the way vulnerabilities are commonly exploited by ransomware, their sharing ratio and the definition of their common causes and impacts. We have built a database, by scrapping multiple publicly available security reports, which associates each known ransomware to its used vulnerability contained in the CVE. We have applied a semantic annotation methodology which encompasses a semantic analysis of the CVE dataset through a pattern recognition process. This latter has enabled the extraction for each CVE of its key features, i.e., the cause, the performed exploit action and effect, as well as its impact. In the resulting collected and extracted knowledge we show a twofold analysis, statistical and semantic, of the CVE descriptions and their extracted features.",

The significant characteristic of proposed method is dispensing of disassemble process by direct extraction of features from raw byte with the use of frequent pattern mining which remarkably increases the detection speed. The Gain Ratio technique was used for feature selection which exhibited that 1000 features was the optimal number for detection process. The current study involved using random forest classifier with a comprehensive analysis to the effect of both tree and seed numbers on the ransomware detection.

    "abstract": "The internet of things (ransomware refers to a type of malware) is the concept of connecting devices and objects of all types on the internet. IoT cybersecurity is the task of protecting ecosystems and IoT gadgets from cyber threats. Currently, ransomware is a serious threat challenging the computing environment, which needs instant attention to avoid moral and financial blackmail. Thus, there comes a real need for a novel technique that can identify and stop this kind of attack. Several earlier detection techniques followed a dynamic analysis method including a complex process. However, this analysis takes a long period of time for processing and analysis, during which the malicious payload is often sent. This study presents a new model of dwarf mongoose optimization with machine-learning-driven ransomware detection (DWOML-RWD). The presented DWOML-RWD model was mainly developed for the recognition and classification of goodware/ransomware. In the presented DWOML-RWD technique, the feature selection process is initially carried out using an enhanced krill herd optimization (EKHO) algorithm by the use of dynamic oppositional-based learning (QOBL). For ransomware detection, DWO with an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier can be utilized. The design of the DWO algorithm aids in the optimal parameter selection of the ELM model. The experimental validation of the DWOML-RWD method can be examined on a benchmark dataset. The experimental results highlight the superiority of the DWOML-RWD model over other approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ransomware is a type of malware that affects the victim data by modifying, deleting, or blocking their access. In recent years, ransomware attacks have resulted in critical data and financial losses to individuals and industries. These disruptions force the need for developing effective anti-ransomware methods in the research community. However, most of the existing techniques are designed to detect a specific ransomware variant instead of providing a generic solution mainly because of the obfuscation techniques used by ransomware or the use of static analysis methods. In this context, this paper proposes a novel ransomware-detection technique that identifies ransomware attacks by evaluating the current state of a computer system with knowledge of a ransomware attack. The finite-state machine model is used to synthesise the knowledge of the ransomware attack with respect to the victim machine. The proposed method monitors the changes happening in the computer system in terms of utilisation, persistence, and lateral movement of its resources to detect ransomware attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect attacks from different ransomware variants with significantly few false predictions.",

To analyze all samples by hand to discover whether they are malware does not scale, so antivirus companies automate the process e.g., using sandboxes where samples can be run, observed, and classified. Malware authors are aware of this fact, and try to evade detection. In this paper we describe one of such evasion technique: unprecedented, we discovered it while analyzing a ransomware sample. Analyzed in a Cuckoo Sandbox, the sample was able to avoid triggering malware indicators, thus scoring significantly below the minimum severity level. Here, we discuss what strategy the sample follows to evade the analysis, proposing practical defense methods to nullify, in our turn, the sample's furtive strategy.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of digital networks and information systems has transformed modern society, but it has also led to a surge in sophisticated cyber threats such as malware, phishing, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Traditional rule-based security systems are increasingly ineffective against these evolving threats, often failing to detect novel attack patterns, leading to false positives, missed detections, and delayed responses. This study aimed to address these challenges by applying machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cyber-attack detection. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which contains 175,341 training and 82,332 testing records representing both benign and malicious network traffic with 49 relevant features, the research applied synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality by retaining up to 95% of data variance. Five machine learning models Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.The results demonstrated that KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 94.69%, with balanced precision (95.31%), recall (93.96%), and F1 score (94.63%), showing robust classification of both attack and non-attack instances. Random Forest and ANN also showed strong performances with accuracies of 92.81% and 95%, respectively, highlighting their effectiveness in handling complex cybersecurity data. SVM and Decision Tree had slightly lower accuracies of 90.88% and 92.22%. These findings confirm the value of machine learning, especially KNN and ensemble methods, for real-world intrusion detection. Regular model retraining is essential to address emerging attack patterns and maintain effective cybersecurity defenses.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement and transformation of technology, information and communication technologies (ICT), in particular, have attracted everyone’s attention. The attackers took advantage of this and can caused serious problems, such as malware attack, ransomware, SQL injection attack, etc. One of the dominant attacks, known as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), has been observed as the main reason for information hacking. In this paper, we have proposed a secure technique, called the low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) technique, to measure attack penetration and secure communication flow. A two-step clustering method was adopted, where the network traffic was controlled by using the characteristics of TCP traffic with discrete sense; then, the suspicious cluster with the abnormal analysis was detected. This method has proven to be reliable and efficient for LDDoS attacks detection, based on the NS-2 simulator, compared to the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) technique, which has comparatively very high false-positive rates. Analyzing abnormal test pieces helps us reduce the false positives. The proposed methodology was implemented using Python for scripting and NS-2 simulator for topology, two public trademark datasets, i.e., Web of Information for Development (WIDE) and Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory (LBNL), were selected for experiments. The experiments were analyzed, and the results evaluated using Wireshark. The proposed LDDoS approach achieved good results, compared to the previous techniques.",

However, criminals increasingly exploit these advancements to commit crimes, including malware attacks. Malware is software that infiltrates and damages computers, resulting in financial and material losses. To prevent such attacks, analyzing malware functionality and characteristics is essential. Three methods for malware analysis are static, dynamic, and hybrid approaches, which provide comprehensive results and information. Using these methods, the author examined Petya, CryptInfinite, and Locky Ransomware, focusing on ransomware due to its ability to lock user data and demand ransom. Static analysis revealed that multiple security vendors identified all three types of malware as malicious files and could extract information from various Process IDs on the computer. Dynamic analysis showed that Petya.A.exe and CryptInfinite.exe could operate on the Windows victim, while Locky.AZ.exe could not. Hybrid analysis revealed that Petya.A.exe caused direct damage to the victim’s Windows system, while InfinityCrypt.exe operated silently to collect information about the infected system.

    "abstract": "In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.",

    "title": "A novel technique for ransomware detection using image based dynamic features and transfer learning to address dataset limitations",
    "abstract": "The increasing frequency of ransomware attacks necessitates the development of more effective detection methods. Existing image-based ransomware detection approaches have largely focused on static analysis, overlooking specialized ransomware behaviors such as encryption, privilege escalation, and system recovery disruption. Although dynamic and memory forensics-based visualization methods exist in the broader malware domain, they primarily target generic malware families and often rely on memory dumps or system snapshots without transforming behavioral features into spatially meaningful representations. Moreover, traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) typically depend on manual feature engineering and large labelled datasets, limiting scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel behavior-to-image ransomware detection framework that transforms dynamic behavioral features extracted from sandbox-generated JSON reports into two-dimensional (2D) grayscale and color image representations, optimized for transfer learning (TL), enabling effective classification under small-data conditions. Our approach integrates domain-specific feature filtering and impact analysis to ensure the selection of the most ransomware-relevant attributes. TL subsequently automates feature extraction and classification, eliminating the need for separate feature selection procedures and overcoming the time-consuming process of manual feature engineering. Furthermore, by leveraging prior knowledge from large-scale image datasets, TL significantly mitigates the need for extensive labelled data while maintaining high detection accuracy and strong generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned pretrained models, notably ResNet50, achieve up to 99.96% accuracy with a minimal loss factor of 0.0026, even with a small dataset of 500 ransomware and 500 benign samples. We further validated the model’s interpretability through t-SNE visualizations and saliency maps, confirming its ability to focus on class-discriminative behavioral patterns. The low misclassification rate, along with the transparency of the model, highlights its potential for practical deployment in ransomware detection systems.

    "title": "RSSD: defend against ransomware with hardware-isolated network-storage codesign and post-attack analysis",
    "abstract": "Encryption ransomware has become a notorious malware. It encrypts user data on storage devices like solid-state drives (SSDs) and demands a ransom to restore data for users. To bypass existing defenses, ransomware would keep evolving and performing new attack models. For instance, we identify and validate three new attacks, including (1) garbage-collection (GC) attack that exploits storage capacity and keeps writing data to trigger GC and force SSDs to release the retained data; (2) timing attack that intentionally slows down the pace of encrypting data and hides its I/O patterns to escape existing defense; (3) trimming attack that utilizes the trim command available in SSDs to physically erase data. To enhance the robustness of SSDs against these attacks, we propose RSSD, a ransomware-aware SSD. It redesigns the flash management of SSDs for enabling the hardware-assisted logging, which can conservatively retain older versions of user data and received storage operations in time order with low overhead. It also employs hardware-isolated NVMe over Ethernet to expand local storage capacity by transparently offloading the logs to remote cloud/servers in a secure manner. RSSD enables post-attack analysis by building a trusted evidence chain of storage operations to assist the investigation of ransomware attacks. We develop RSSD with a real-world SSD FPGA board. Our evaluation shows that RSSD can defend against new and future ransomware attacks, while introducing negligible performance overhead.",

    "title": "Ranker: Early Ransomware Detection Through Kernel-Level Behavioral Analysis",
    "abstract": "Ransomware is a rapidly evolving type of malware crafted to encrypt user files, rendering them inaccessible and demanding a ransom. The impact of ransomware attacks on both enterprises and individuals is significant. However, early detection of such malware remains a formidable challenge with current detection methods. In this paper, we propose Ranker, a real-time approach designed for early ransomware detection through kernel-level behavioral analysis. Analyzing various ransomware families, we discovered that half of these attacks exhibit stealthy behaviors preceding the actual attack. Extracting insights from the pre-attack malicious behavior proves effective for early detection of ransomware. For ransomware families that encrypt files directly, considering that interacting with user files is their goal, our focus is on monitoring file changes during the attack, hoping to detect ransomware when fewer files are lost. Therefore, Ranker systematically characterizes the kernel-level behavior of ransomware during the pre-attack and attack stages, identifying general and essential characteristics. Ranker also introduces a lightweight detector for real-time ransomware detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ranker achieves an average F1 score of 99.43% in ransomware detection, with a mere 0.11% false positives across 68 distinct ransomware families. Notably, Ranker detects 95% of ransomware attacks with no more than one file encrypted and attains a 97.16% accuracy in identifying 22 previously unseen ransomware families.",

    "title": "Evaluating The Efficacy and Safety of the Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Discovery Lock Agents in Harbor-Lock for Enterprise-Scale Penetration Testing",
    "abstract": "The nature and size of global corporate IT infrastructure have grown at a staggering rate, creating demand for more advanced virtualization and security tool sets to mitigate strategic security gaps and vulnerabilities. This paper focuses on the safety and efficacy of Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Discovery Lock Agents (RV-DLA) within the Harbor-Lock pen-testing tool, tailored for enterprise environments. Harbor-Lock combines multiple pen testing methodologies and automates the process to streamline network security assessments of large, multilayered environments. RV-DLA is the main component of Harbor-Lock, performing operational reconnaissance and, for a limited period, discovering system vulnerabilities with minimal perturbation to the operational system. This paper examines the effectiveness of RV-DLA agents in diverse enterprise environments and measures safety in terms of operational perturbation of system stability, performance, and data integrity. The findings indicate that RV-DLA has a high Rate of Correct Discovery (RCD) for critical vulnerabilities, including zero-day, sensitive, and/or misconfiguration issues, with an extremely low false discovery rate. Safety assessment indicates significant improvement in managing system disruptions and data corruption, thereby striking a unique balance in enterprise environments. The study reports 90% asset coverage, 20% high-vulnerability rate, 8% false-positive rate, 20% exploitability validation rate, and 18% repeat-finding rate. This paper discusses the strategic Strengths and Weaknesses of implementing Harbor-Lock with RV-DLA agents for enterprise-level penetration testing to integrate Cybersecurity workflows and propose possible ends to the ongoing imbalance of enterprise-level testing tools and practices.",

    "title": "LLM-Driven Automated Penetration Testing: Architectures, Benchmarks, and Safety Considerations",
    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward using large language models (LLMs) to automate penetration testing tasks, including reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploit identification, and reporting. Previous works, including PentestGPT, Curriculum PT, RapidPen, White Rabbit Neo- PentestGPT, and HackSynth, have shown that LLM guided workflows can be superior to naive prompting and traditional scripting-based approaches on both capture the flag (CTF) challenges and realistic lab environments, and have attracted significant community interest and public benchmarking. Nevertheless, the complete automation of penetration testing remains an unsolved problem: current tools continue to fail to address issues related to managing context, orchestrating tools, handling environmental variations, and enforcing safety constraints. In this paper, we introduce a unified LLM-driven automated Penetration Testing Framework that divides the workflow of penetration testing into formally defined tasks, states, and actions, utilizing LLM-based agents to develop, execute, and modify multi-step attack chains across multiple layers of networks, web, cloud, and application environments. We detail how to integrate external tools (scanners, exploit frameworks, and knowledge bases) into the framework, design a memory and reasoning layer to prevent the loss of context, and define safety and governance controls to limit the misuse of the system. We conduct experiments using synthetic labs, standardized CTFstyle benchmarks, and real-world-inspired scenarios, and compare our results against those obtained from human testers, scripted pipelines, and previous LLM-based systems. Our results indicate significant improvements in task completion, coverage, and time-to-compromise, while also identifying failure modes and informing future research directions. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference architecture and experimental guide for next-generation, LLM-driven penetration testing.",

    "title": "The Role of AI in Modern Penetration Testing",
    "abstract": "Penetration testing is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, traditionally driven by manual, time-intensive processes. As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration. This paper offers a critical overview of AI's current and potential role in penetration testing, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and organizations aiming to enhance security assessments through advanced automation or looking for gaps in existing research.",

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of modern network environments, coupled with threat actors adoption of multi-stage, tool-chain-driven campaigns, has rendered manual penetration testing (pentesting) time-consuming and increasingly ineffective. This study proposes a comprehensive cyber-security knowledge graph (CS-KG) that reconciles disparate data from penetrationtesting tool outputs, the MCP framework, network topology artefacts, asset inventories, and vulnerability databases. By fusing these heterogeneous sources into a high-precision, semantically coherent graph, we enable advanced inference over attack paths, asset criticality, and control efficacy. A reasoning engine built atop the CS-KG dynamically prescribes automated pentesting actions that are context-aware and risk-weighted. Experiments on an enterprise-grade, 1800 -node testbed demonstrate that our framework shortens threat-path discovery time by 63%, raises vulnerability coverage by 48%, and reduces redundant exploit attempts by $\\mathbf{4 1 \\%}$ relative to state-of-practice automation baselines. The results underline that graph-driven knowledge representation is a tractable route to scalable and intelligent pentesting orchestration for critical infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Currently, websites are widely used in various fields, including government. However, government websites are often the target of hacking. The XY Regency Communication and Information Agency experienced a website breach in 2023, which affected one of its subdomains, e-office.xy-regency.go.id, which stored employee data. This hack resulted in the leakage of sensitive data, user account takeovers, service disruptions, and a decline in public trust. The purpose of this study was to identify and test the vulnerabilities of the e-office.xy-regency.go.id website using the NIST SP 800-115 method, which includes the planning, discovery, attack, and reporting phases. Vulnerabilities were classified using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the OWASP Top 10 standard. This study identified two high-level vulnerabilities, namely Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with a CVSS score of 8.2, classified as High severity, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) with a CVSS score of 9.3, classified as Critical severity. These vulnerabilities could allow hackers to execute malicious scripts and manipulate users without their knowledge. Recommendations include implementing input validation on text boxes by limiting characters to letters or combinations of letters and numbers, and ensuring that all forms and endpoints that handle sensitive data are protected with unique and unpredictable CSRF tokens. Future research should focus on analyzing domain vulnerabilities, identifying the origin and potential of attacks, and developing effective protection and recovery strategies.",

This algorithm enhances the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, and introduces advantage function normalization, policy entropy, dynamic reward scaling, and gradient clipping techniques. We first convert the network topology and vulnerability information into an attack graph by MulVAL, and then train the Agent to continuously explore and update the strategy on the attack graph by using the NHSC-PPO algorithm, and finally find the attack path with the highest reward value in the dataset. Experimental results in various scenarios show that, compared with PPO, Double Dueling DQN and DQN algorithms, the penetration testing path discovery of NHSC-PPO algorithm can more efficiently and accurately converge to the path with the highest reward, and then determining the optimal attack path.",

Malicious actors have many tactics at their disposal, and software engineers need to know what tactics attackers will prioritize in the first few hours of an attack. Projects like MITRE ATT&CK™ provide knowledge, but how do people actually deploy this knowledge in real situations? A penetration testing competition provides a realistic, controlled environment with which to measure and compare the efficacy of attackers. In this work, we examine the details of vulnerability discovery and attacker behavior with the goal of improving existing vulnerability assessment processes using data from the 2019 Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC). We constructed 98 timelines of vulnerability discovery and exploits for 37 unique vulnerabilities discovered by 10 teams of penetration testers. We grouped related vulnerabilities together by mapping to Common Weakness Enumerations and MITRE ATT&CK™. We found that (1) vulnerabilities related to improper resource control (e.g., session fixation) are discovered faster and more often, as well as exploited faster, than vulnerabilities related to improper access control (e.g., weak password requirements), (2) there is a clear process followed by penetration testers of discovery/collection to lateral movement/pre-attack. Our methodology facilitates quicker analysis of vulnerabilities in future CPTC events.",

    "abstract": "Discovering vulnerabilities in applications of real-world complexity is a daunting task: a vulnerability may affect a single line of code, and yet it compromises the security of the entire application. Even worse, vulnerabilities may manifest only in exceptional circumstances that do not occur in the normal operation of the application. It is widely recognized that state-of-the-art penetration testing tools play a crucial role, and are routinely used, to dig up vulnerabilities. Yet penetration testing is still primarily a human-driven activity, and its effectiveness still depends on the skills and ingenuity of the security analyst driving the tool. In this paper, we propose a technique for the automatic discovery of vulnerabilities in event-based systems, such as web and mobile applications. Our approach is based on a collaborative, co-evolutionary and contract-driven search strategy that iteratively (i) executes a pool of test cases, (ii) identifies the most promising ones, and (iii) generates new test cases from them. The approach makes a synergistic combination of evolutionary algorithms where several \"species\" contribute to solving the problem: one species, the test species, evolves to find the target test case, i.e., the set of instruction whose execution lead to the vulnerable statement, whereas the other species, called contract species, evolve to select the parameters for the procedure calls needed to trigger the vulnerability. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented a working prototype and ran it against both a case study and a benchmark web application. The experimental results confirm that our tool automatically discovers and executes a number of injection flaw attacks that are out of reach for state-of-the-art web scanners.",

We conducted a single-case study with an IoT consultancy company, combining semi-structured interviews with practitioners and analysis of development artefacts from a real-world IoT project. Our findings show that while threat identification is practiced, formal methodologies like STRIDE are only used selectively, and integration into the development process is informal and ad hoc. Vulnerability assessment also lacks systematic approaches for discovery, classification, and testing, often relying on expert judgment and external tools. We identify key attack surfaces and common security weaknesses, and highlight gaps in documentation and testing integration. The study contributes practical recommendations for improving security practices and provides a curated list of open-source penetration testing tools.

Note that this vulnerability is not reproducible on a local deployment due to the extremely low latency of responses to login requests.\n2. In a terminal run `export LOGIN_URL='https://example.com/api/v1/login'`, replacing `example.com` with your remote Fides server's domain or IP address.\n3. In the same terminal run `exploit-poc.sh` (detailed below).\n4. It's possible to distinguish between valid and invalid users based on the low latency (time difference) for invalid users.  \n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Exploit PoC script</summary>\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Function to test login and calculate average transfer times\ntest_login(){\n  echo -e \"\\nTesting login for user: $1\\n\"\n  total_diff=0\n\n  for (( i=1; i <= 20; ++i ))\n  do\n    echo -n \"Attempt #$i: \"\n    resp=$(curl -w @- \"$LOGIN_URL\" \\\n      -H 'content-type: application/json' \\\n      --data-raw '{\"username\":\"'$1'\"",

These versions are enforced by the `urllib3[brotli]` extra in the patched versions of urllib3.\n\n\n### Credits\n\nThe issue was reported by @Cycloctane.\nSupplemental information was provided by @stamparm during a security audit performed by [7ASecurity](https://7asecurity.com/) and facilitated by [OSTIF](https://ostif.org/).",

    "abstract": "**Note:** This report has already been discussed with the Google OSS VRP team, who recommended that I reach out directly to the Keras team. I’ve chosen to do so privately rather than opening a public issue, due to the potential security implications. I also attempted to use the email address listed in your `SECURITY.md`, but received no response.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen a model in the `.h5` (or `.hdf5`) format is loaded using the Keras `Model.load_model` method, the `safe_mode=True` setting is **silently** ignored without any warning or error. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine with the same privileges as the Keras application. This report is specific to the `.h5`/`.hdf5` file format.

This is a significant security risk because `joblib` does not enforce the same security measures as `skops`, allowing arbitrary code execution.\n\n```python\n# from `card/_model_card.py:354-358`\ntry:\n    if zipfile.is_zipfile(model_path):\n        model = load(model_path, trusted=trusted)\n    else:\n        model = joblib.load(model_path)\n```\n\nTo increase the concern, `get_model` is actually called internally by `skops` during card creation, so the user does not need to call it explicitly—only to create the `Card` object passing a `joblib` file.\n\n## PoC\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```python\nfrom skops.card import Card\n\ncard = Card(\"model.skops\")\n```\n\nAn attacker could share a `model.skops` file that, de",

This could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases.\n\n<details>\n\nTo pass extra control data between extractors (such as headers like `Referer`), yt-dlp employs a concept of \"url smuggling\". This works by adding this extra data as json to the url fragment (\"smuggling\") that is then passed on to an extractor. The receiving extractor then \"unsmuggles\" the data from the input url. This functionality is intended to be internal only.\n\nCurrently, the Generic extractor supports receiving an arbitrary dictionary of HTTP headers in a smuggled url, of which it extracts and adds them to the initial request it makes to such url. This is useful when a url sent to the Generic extractor needs a `Referer` header sent with it, for example.\n\nAdditionally, yt-dlp has internal headers to set a proxy for a request: `Ytdl-request-proxy` and `Ytdl-socks-proxy`. While these are deprecated, internally `Ytdl-request-proxy` is still used for `--geo-verification-proxy`.\n\nHowever, it is possible for a maliciously crafted site include these smuggled options in a url which then the Generic extractor extracts and redirects to itself.

If these options are provided as a single string, the code applies `.includes` directly on the string, resulting in substring matching instead of membership checks against an array.\n\n### Affected Versions\nAll versions up to and including 1.16.1 (npm).\n\n### Impact\nSupplying crafted input can bypass intended allow-lists (e.g., class/environment constraints) due to substring checks, which may enable rendering of unintended classes or environments and lead to policy bypass in downstream consumers.\n\n### Mitigation\nUntil an upstream fix is released, ensure configuration normalization before invoking the plugins:\n- Validate that `allowedClasses` and `allowedEnvironments` are arrays (`Array.isArray(...)`), converting single strings into one-element arrays when necessary.\n- Consider sanitizing or strictly validating user-controlled values that influence Markdown rendering.",

By supplying local file paths, such as `file:///etc/passwd`, an attacker can read sensitive data from the server.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability arises because the system does not properly validate or sanitize the user input for the URL field.

    "abstract": "### Description\nAn insecure default configuration in FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative access and execute arbitrary code on the server. This affects FUXA through version 1.2.9 when authentication is enabled, but the administrator JWT secret is not configured. This issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10.\n\n### Impact\nThe FUXA documentation allows administrators to manually update a hardcoded JWT secret when enabling authentication. This feature was not available in the UI. This results in a fail-open security posture, where the application can report or appear to be operating in `secureEnabled` mode while still accepting tokens signed with a publicly known key.\n\nExploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to forge JWTs to bypass all authentication mechanisms and obtain administrative access to the FUXA instance. With these elevated privileges, the attacker can interact with administrative APIs, including intended features designed for automation and scripting, to execute arbitrary code in the context of the FUXA service. Depending on deployment configuration and permissions, this may lead to full system compromise and could further expose connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.10. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.\n\n### Notes\nGitHub stated this vulnerability is identical to CVE-2025-69971, which was published against the repository out of band before coordinated disclosure concluded.

Both are most common in stateless deployments.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis advisory covers two related but distinct vulnerabilities. A deployment may be affected by one or both.\n\n#### Issue 1: Transport re-use\n\n**What happens:** When a single `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` instance handles multiple client requests, JSON-RPC message ID collisions cause responses to be routed to the wrong client's HTTP connection. The transport maintains an internal `requestId → stream` mapping, and since MCP client SDKs generate message IDs using an incrementing counter starting at 0, two clients produce identical IDs. The second client's request overwrites the first client's mapping entry, routing the response to the wrong HTTP stream.\n\n**What is affected:** All request types — `tools/call`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get`, etc. No server-initiated features are required to trigger this.\n\n**Conditions:**\n- A single `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` instance is reused across multiple client requests (most common in stateless mode without `sessionIdGenerator`)\n- Two or more clients send requests concurrently\n- Clients generate overlapping JSON-RPC message IDs (the SDK's default client uses an incrementing counter starting at 0)\n\n#### Issue 2: Server/Protocol re-use\n\n**What happens:** When a single `McpServer` (or `Server`) instance is `connect()`ed to multiple transports (one per client), the Protocol's internal `this._transport` reference is silently overwritten. The final response to a request is routed correctly (the Protocol captures the transport reference at request time), but any **server-to-client messages sent during request handling** use the shared `this._transport` reference, which may point to a different client's transport.\n\n**What is affected:** This depen",

This causes the parser to throw an uncaught exception, crashing any application that processes untrusted XML input.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability exists in `/src/xmlparser/OrderedObjParser.js` at lines 44-45:\n\n```javascript\n\"num_dec\": { regex: /&#([0-9]{1,7});/g, val : (_, str) => String.fromCodePoint(Number.parseInt(str, 10)) },\n\"num_hex\": { regex: /&#x([0-9a-fA-F]{1,6});/g, val : (_, str) => String.fromCodePoint(Number.parseInt(str, 16)) },\n```\n\nThe `String.fromCodePoint()` method throws a `RangeError` when the code point exceeds the valid Unicode range (0 to 0x10FFFF / 1114111).

An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split.

    "abstract": "### Summary\n\nA Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Beego's `RenderForm()` function due to improper HTML escaping of user-controlled data. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in victims' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or account takeover. The vulnerability affects any application using Beego's `RenderForm()` function with user-provided data. Since it is a high-level function generating an entire form markup, many developers would assume it automatically escapes attributes (the way most frameworks do).\n\n### Details\n\nThe vulnerability is located in the `renderFormField()` function in Beego's `templatefunc.go` file (around lines 316-356). This function directly injects user-provided values into HTML without proper escaping:\n\n```go\nreturn fmt.Sprintf(`%v<input%v%v name=\"%v\" type=\"%v\" value=\"%v\"%v>`, \n    label, id, class, name, fType, value, requiredString)\n```\n\nNone of the values (label, id, class, name, value) are properly HTML-escaped before being inserted into the HTML template. This allows attackers to break out of the attribute context or inject HTML tags directly.\nThe vulnerability can be exploited in two main ways:\n\n- Attribute Injection: By injecting code into fields like DisplayName, an attacker can break out of the attribute context and execute JavaScript.\n- Content Injection: By injecting HTML tags into textarea content, an attacker can execute JavaScript.\n\nThe `RenderForm()` function returns `template.HTML`, which bypasses Go's automatic HTML escaping, making this vulnerability particularly dangerous.\n\n### PoC\n\nRetrieve the following (secret) gist: https://gist.github.com/thevilledev/8fd0cab3f098320aa9daab04be59fd2b\n\nTo run it:\n\n```go\ngo mod init beego-xss-poc\ngo mod tidy\ngo run poc.go\n```\n\nOpen your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/\n\nThe application demonstrates the vulnerability through several examples:\n- `/profile` - Shows a profile with m",

    "abstract": "### Summary\nAn attacker can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the default admin account. This flaw undermines a previously [patched CVE](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security_considerations/#cve-2020-8827-insufficient-anti-automationanti-brute-force) intended to protect against brute-force attacks.\n\n### Details\nThe application's brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a `defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users, thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and effectively resetting the rate limit for that account.\n\nThe brute force protection mechanism's code:\n```go\n   if failed && len(failures) >= getMaximumCacheSize() {\n       log.Warnf(\"Session cache size exceeds %d entries, removing random entry\",\n\ngetMaximumCacheSize())\n       idx := rand.Intn(len(failures) - 1)\n       var rmUser string\n       i := 0\n       for key := range failures {\n\n           if i == idx {\n               rmUser = key\n\n               delete(failures, key)\n\nbreak\n\n}\n\ni++ }\n\n       log.Infof(\"Deleted entry for user %s from cache\", rmUser)\n   }\n```\n\n### PoC\n1. Set up the application environment and identify the login page.\n2. Execute 4 failed login attempts for the admin account.\n3. Run a Burp Intruder attack to populate the cache with login attempts for usernames ranging from 1 to 10000.\n4. After 1000 attempts, start monitoring to see if the admin entries in the cache have been cleared.\n5. At this point, brute-force the admin account.\n\nIn just 15 minutes, the PoC was able to perform 230 brute force attempts on the admin account. This rate allows for approximately 1000 requests per hour, effectively rendering the [older CVE](https://argo-cd.rea",

Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port. ",

The only place that this happens is in the client entrypoint: https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/blob/3de177432cd23db58e57f376b62ad497cc10840f/main.go#L452\n\nThis subverts the expectations set by the documentation, allowing unauthenticated users to connect to a Chisel server, even if auth is attempted to be set up in this manner.\n\n### PoC\nRun `chisel server`, first specifying credentials with the `AUTH` environment variable, then with the `--auth` argument. In the first case, the server allows connections without authentication, while in the second, the correct behavior is exhibited.\n\n### Impact\nAnyone who is running the Chisel server, and that is using the `AUTH` environment variable to specify credentials to authenticate against. Chisel is often used to provide an entrypoint to a private network, which means services that are gated by Chisel may be affected. Additionally, Chisel is often used for exposing services to the internet. An attacker could MITM requests by connecting to a Chisel server and requesting to forward traffic from a remote port. ",

To address this issue, strong encryption schemes use what is known as \"key commitment\", a process by which an encrypted message can only be decrypted by one key; the key used to originally encrypt the message. \n\nIn older versions of S3EC, when customers are also using a feature called \"Instruction File\" to store EDKs, key commitment is not implemented because multiple EDKs could be associated to an underlying encrypted message object.  For such customers an attack that leverages the lack of key commitment is possible.  A bad actor would need two things to leverage this issue: (i) the ability to create a separate, rogue, EDK that will also decrypt the underlying object to produce desired plaintext, and (ii) permission to upload a new instruction file to the S3 bucket to replace the existing instruction file placed there by the user using the S3C.  Any future attempt to decrypt the underlying encrypted message with the S3EC will unwittingly use the rogue EDK to produce a valid plaintext message.\n\nImpacted versions: <= v3.1\n\n\n### Patches\n\nAmazon S3 Encryption Client is introducing the concept of \"key commitment\" to S3EC where the EDK is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext in order to address this issue.

To address this issue, strong encryption schemes use what is known as \"key commitment\", a process by which an encrypted message can only be decrypted by one key; the key used to originally encrypt the message. \n\nIn older versions of S3EC, when customers are also using a feature called \"Instruction File\" to store EDKs, key commitment is not implemented because multiple EDKs could be associated to an underlying encrypted message object.  For such customers an attack that leverages the lack of key commitment is possible.  A bad actor would need two things to leverage this issue: (i) the ability to create a separate, rogue, EDK that will also decrypt the underlying object to produce desired plaintext, and (ii) permission to upload a new instruction file to the S3 bucket to replace the existing instruction file placed there by the user using the S3C.  Any future attempt to decrypt the underlying encrypted message with the S3EC will unwittingly use the rogue EDK to produce a valid plaintext message.\n\nImpacted versions: <= v3.1\n\n\n### Patches\n\nAmazon S3 Encryption Client is introducing the concept of \"key commitment\" to S3EC where the EDK is cryptographically bound to the ciphertext in order to address this issue.

Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. A placeholder for a numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus (i.e. `-`)\n1. There must be a second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder on the same line. \n1. Both parameters must be user controlled.\n\nThe prior behavior of the driver when operating in simple query mode would inline the negative value of the first parameter and cause the resulting line to be treated as a `--` SQL comment.

Users that do not override the query mode are not impacted.\n\n# Exploitation\n\nTo exploit this behavior the following conditions must be met:\n\n1.

When configuring the connector via the Kafka Connect REST API, an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config` property for any of the connector's Kafka clients to \"com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule\", which can be done via the `producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.

This includes casts performed when returning values from methods, when assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).\n- In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, when casting an array-like value to an array type, per-element casts to the component type of the array are not intercepted by the sandbox (CVE-2022-43403).\n- In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, crafted constructor bodies and calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors can be used to construct any subclassable type (due to an incomplete fix for SECURITY-1754 in the [2020-03-09 security advisory](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-03-09/#SECURITY-1754)) (CVE-2022-43404).\n\nThese vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.\n\nThese vulnerabilities have been fixed:\n\n- Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b_d851b_3 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2803.v1a_f77ffcc773 intercept Groovy casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-4",

So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing edition of the user profiles and then downloading the XML that has been created. This is also true for any document that might contain password field and that a user can view.\nThis vulnerability impacts all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have the Change request right (allowed by default) and view rights on the page to target. \nAlso the issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated way. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages that contains a password field with change request.

    "description": "### Impact\n\nChange request allows to edit any page by default, and the changes are then exported in an XML that anyone can download. So it's possible for an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing edition of the user profiles and then downloading the XML that has been created. This is also true for any document that might contain password field and that a user can view.\nThis vulnerability impacts all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have the Change request right (allowed by default) and view rights on the page to target. \nAlso the issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated way. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages that contains a password field with change request. It means that already existing change request for those pages won't be removed by the patch, administrators needs to take care of it. \n\nThe patch is provided in Change Request 1.10, administrators should upgrade immediately. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround the vulnerability by denying manually the Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki space which will include any user profile by default. \n\n### References\n\n  * JIRA issue: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CRAPP-302\n  * Commit of the fix: https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-changerequest/commit/ff0f5368ea04f0e4aa7b33821c707dc68a8c5ca8\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThanks Michael Hamann for the report.

This is due to parsing behavior in the [neko-htmlunit](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-neko) dependency, just by updating to a newer version the issue was solved. See important remediation details in the reference given below.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed version of the library, the following mitigation can be applied until you can upgrade: Manually edit your AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`,  if present.\n\nAs the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library. However, the existing bug would still be present in the parser dependency (neko-htmlunit) and therefore in AntiSamy. The safety of this workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.\n\n# For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail one of the project co-leaders, listed on the [OWASP AntiSamy project](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/) page, under \"Leaders\".\n",

This is due to parsing behavior in the [neko-htmlunit](https://github.com/HtmlUnit/htmlunit-neko) dependency, just by updating to a newer version the issue was solved. See important remediation details in the reference given below.\n\n# Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed version of the library, the following mitigation can be applied until you can upgrade: Manually edit your AntiSamy policy file (e.g., antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting its value to `false`,  if present.\n\nAs the previously mentioned policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work, changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this library. However, the existing bug would still be present in the parser dependency (neko-htmlunit) and therefore in AntiSamy. The safety of this workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.\n\n# For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail one of the project co-leaders, listed on the [OWASP AntiSamy project](https://owasp.org/www-project-antisamy/) page, under \"Leaders\".\n",

    "abstract": "### Impact\nA [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content insertion code.  This allowed `iframe` elements containing malicious code to execute when inserted into the editor.  These `iframe` elements are restricted in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations such as downloading of malicious assets.\n\n### Fix\nTinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new `sandbox_iframes` boolean option which adds the `sandbox=\"\"` attribute to every `iframe` element by default when enabled. This will prevent cross-origin, and in special cases same-origin, XSS by embedded resources in `iframe` elements. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards the default value of this option is `true`.\n\nIn TinyMCE 7.0.0 a new `sandbox_iframes_exclusions` option was also added, allowing a list of domains to be specified that should be excluded from having the `sandbox=\"\"` attribute applied when the `sandbox_iframes` option is enabled. By default, this option is set to an array of domains that are provided in embed code by popular websites. To sandbox `iframe` elements from every domain, set this option to `[]`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) `frame-src` or `object-src` can be configured to restrict or block the loading of unauthorized URLS.  Refer to the [TinyMCE Content Security Policy Guide](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/tinymce-and-csp/).\n\n### References\n- [TinyMCE 6.8.1](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-convert_unsafe_embeds-option-that-controls-whether-object-and-embed-elements-will-be-converted-to-more-restrictive-alternatives-namely-img-for-image-mime-types-video-for-video-mime-types-audio-audio-mime-types-or-iframe-for-other-or-unspecified-mime-types)\n- [TinyMCE 7.0.0](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/7/7.0-release-notes/#sandbox_iframes-editor-option-is-now-defaulted-to-true)\n",

These `iframe` elements are restricted in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations such as downloading of malicious assets.\n\n### Fix\nTinyMCE 6.8.1 introduced a new `sandbox_iframes` boolean option which adds the `sandbox=\"\"` attribute to every `iframe` element by default when enabled. This will prevent cross-origin, and in special cases same-origin, XSS by embedded resources in `iframe` elements. From TinyMCE 7.0.0 onwards the default value of this option is `true`.\n\nIn TinyMCE 7.0.0 a new `sandbox_iframes_exclusions` option was also added, allowing a list of domains to be specified that should be excluded from having the `sandbox=\"\"` attribute applied when the `sandbox_iframes` option is enabled. By default, this option is set to an array of domains that are provided in embed code by popular websites. To sandbox `iframe` elements from every domain, set this option to `[]`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) `frame-src` or `object-src` can be configured to restrict or block the loading of unauthorized URLS.  Refer to the [TinyMCE Content Security Policy Guide](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/latest/tinymce-and-csp/).\n\n### References\n- [TinyMCE 6.8.1](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/6.8.1-release-notes/#new-convert_unsafe_embeds-option-that-controls-whether-object-and-embed-elements-will-be-converted-to-more-restrictive-alternatives-namely-img-for-image-mime-types-video-for-video-mime-types-audio-audio-mime-types-or-iframe-for-other-or-unspecified-mime-types)\n- [TinyMCE 7.0.0](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/7/7.0-release-notes/#sandbox_iframes-editor-option-is-now-defaulted-to-true)\n",

    "abstract": "### Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data due to the possibility of deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript objects.\n\n### Description\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

    "description": "### Overview\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data due to the possibility of deserialization of arbitrary JavaScript objects.\n\n### Description\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.\n\nXSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner network.\n\n### Releases\n\nReleases before version 21.12.22.1 are affected.

The attack requires write access to the container in question, and that the attacker has access to an endpoint that reveals decryption failures (without revealing the plaintext) and that when encrypting the CBC option was chosen as content cipher.\n\nThis advisory describes the plaintext revealing vulnerabilities in the Java Azure Blob Storage Encryption SDK, with a similar issue in the other blob storage SDKs being present as well.\n\nIn the current version of the Azure Blob Storage crypto SDK, the only algorithm option that allows users to encrypt files is to AES-CBC, without computing a MAC on the data.\n\nThis exposes a padding oracle vulnerability: If the attacker has write access to the blob container bucket and can observe whether or not an endpoint with access to the key can decrypt a file (without observing the file contents that the endpoint learns in the process), they can reconstruct the plaintext with (on average) 128*length(plaintext) queries to the endpoint, by exploiting CBC's ability to manipulate the bytes of the next block and PKCS5 padding errors.\n\n### Timeline\n**Date reported**: March 29 2022\n**Date preview**: June 16 2022\n**Date GA**: July 11 2022\n**Date disclosed**: July 17 2022",

Upgrade to a version of the library where a fix is available\n1. Add code to your application to put MessagePack into the defensive `UntrustedData` mode.\n1. Identify all MessagePack extensions that implement `IMessagePackFormatter<T>` implementations that do not ship with the MessagePack library to include the security mitigations. This includes those acquired from 3rd party packages and classes included directly into your project. Any AOT formatters generated with the MPC tool must be regenerated with the patched version of mpc.\n1. Review your messagepack-serializable data structures for hash-based collections that use custom or unusual types for the hashed key.

In this release, much of the code was rewritten to use byte references rather than pointers to pinned buffers. This change generally improves performance and reduces workload on the garbage collector. However, when the garbage collector performs compaction and rearranges memory, it must update any byte references on the stack to refer to the updated location. The .NET garbage collector can only update these byte references if they still point within the buffer or to a point one byte past the end of the buffer. If they point outside this area, the buffer itself may be moved while the byte reference stays the same.\n\nThere are several places in 1.1.0 where byte references very briefly point outside the valid areas of buffers. These are at locations in the code being used for buffer range checks. While the invalid references are never dereferenced directly, if a GC compaction were to occur during the brief window when they are on the stack then it could invalidate the buffer range check and allow other operations to overrun the buffer.\n\nThis should be very difficult for an attacker to trigger intentionally. It would require a repetitive bulk attack with the hope that a GC compaction would occur at precisely the right moment during one of the requests. However, one of the range checks with this problem is a check based on input data in the decompression buffer, meaning malformed input data could be used to increase the chance of success.\n\nNote that any resulting buffer overrun is likely to cause access to protected memory, which will then cause an exception and the process to be terminated. Therefore, the most likely result of an attack is a denial of service.\n\n### Patches\nThis is patched in release 1.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nPinning any buffers to a fixed location before using them for compression or decompression should mitigate some, but not all, of these cases.
